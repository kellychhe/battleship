# Battleship!

This is a single-player game where the user will play Battleship against the computer. 
The game begins by creating the user and computer game boards, and prompting the user for 
coordinates to set their ships. Then the game switches between the user and computer prompting 
for coordinates and providing status updates along the way until one player sinks 
all of the ships of the other first. In this version, if someone hits a ship, they can go again.
