  // pass in board with ships and hits & array of misses
  // 2-d array of chars => use marker type to put chars in grid
  // every invocation, start fresh
  // use 2d array of char, traditional for loop to iterate over array of strings and array of chars

  // construct a string to pass to controller that will display after each shot

  // have methods return strings and print from controller (stringBuilders, etc.)
  // all one string or an array of strings, then iterate by row

  // further suggestion, start with 10 x 10 w/o additional empty spaces
  // each square is 3x3 character display (30 x 30)
  // render with space, character, space for each cell => dont need spacing to get spacing
